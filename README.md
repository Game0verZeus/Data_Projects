# Dynamic Friends Directory: A SQL Exploration

## Overview
This project showcases the creation and manipulation of a database table designed to keep track of friends' information, including names, birthdays, and email addresses. By starting with the basics of table creation in SQL, the project gradually introduces more complex operations such as data insertion, updates, and schema modifications. It serves as a proof of my SQL skills and demonstrates the ability to manage relational database information effectively.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to build a solid foundation in SQL operations, particularly focusing on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Through the incremental development of a 'friends' table, I've practiced various SQL commands and deepened my understanding of relational database management.

## How to Use
To use the SQL scripts provided in this repository, you'll need access to a SQL database where you can execute commands. The scripts are designed to be run sequentially to build, modify, and query the friends table.

Feel free to clone this repository and use the SQL scripts as a basis for your own projects or to extend the functionality of the current setup by adding more tables or complex queries.

## Contributing
While this project serves primarily as a personal exploration of SQL, contributions or suggestions for improvements are always welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request if you have ideas on how to enhance this dynamic friends directory.
